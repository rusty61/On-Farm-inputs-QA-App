## ðŸ“Š Database Schema Summary

### Tables Created (9):

1. **owners** - Organization/owner records
   - Primary key: owner_id
   - RLS: Owner-scoped access

2. **profiles** - User profiles
   - Links auth.users to owners
   - Primary key: user_id
   - RLS: Profile ownership

3. **farms** - Farm properties
   - Belongs to owner
   - Primary key: farm_id
   - RLS: Owner-scoped

4. **paddocks** - Field/paddock records
   - Belongs to farm and owner
   - GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude, accuracy)
   - Primary key: paddock_id
   - RLS: Owner-scoped

5. **mixes** - Chemical mix recipes
   - Tank mix compositions
   - Primary key: mix_id
   - RLS: Owner-scoped

6. **mix_items** - Individual chemicals
   - Belongs to mix
   - Product name, quantity, unit
   - Primary key: item_id
   - RLS: Via mix ownership

7. **applications** - Spray applications
   - Records each spray event
   - Links to mix and operator
   - Weather data (wind, temp, humidity)
   - GPS coordinates
   - Primary key: application_id
   - RLS: Owner-scoped

8. **application_paddocks** - Application-paddock links
   - Many-to-many relationship
   - Per-paddock GPS capture
   - Primary key: link_id
   - RLS: Owner-scoped

9. **blynk_stations** - Weather stations
   - Blynk integration configuration
   - Primary key: station_id
   - RLS: Owner-scoped

### Security Policies (36 total):

Each table has 4 policies:
- **SELECT**: View own owner's data
- **INSERT**: Create data for own owner
- **UPDATE**: Modify own owner's data
- **DELETE**: Remove own owner's data

All policies verify ownership through the profiles table linkage to ensure users can only access data belonging to their organization.
